      title: Solidus Guided Tour #The user-visible tour title
      body_text: |+
        Welcome to the Solidus Guided Tour. We'll take you through some of what we think makes Solidus special.

        Buckle up and get ready, and click the "Next" button on the right to begin!
    customize:
      button_action: next
      title: Fully Customizable
      body_text: |+
        First, we want to stress the most important feature of Solidus: It's fully, 100% customizable.

        The frontend you're seeing is the pre-built, default frontend - but everything here can be tossed out and tweaked for even the most edge-case uses. It's not just encouraged - it's expected!
    taxon_menu:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /t/brand/solidus-apparel
      title: Taxon Menu
      selector: .categories #The selector for the object that will be highlighted
      body_text: |+
        But while we're here, let's take a look at the default frontend - starting with the navbar. It automatically uses your taxonomy structure to create what you see here, so you don't have to hardcode in these paths. Any changes you make to the taxonomy, are reflected immediately here.

        While that's easy to manage, maybe you want to handle your navbar differently. Solidus prides itself on being infinitely extensible, so if you'd rather change what's displayed here - or even hardcode it in - it's all good!
spree/taxons:
  show:
    filtering:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /products/monogram-hoodie
      title: Taxon Filtering
      selector: aside
      body_text: |+
        Diving more into the taxonomy, here's our filtering setup. From this widget, you can filter by any number of things - here, we've got price & category, and brands, but with minimal setup you can filter by whatever attributes you want.
spree/products:
  show:
    product_properties:
      button_action: next
      title: Product Properties
      selector: .product-properties
      body_text: |+
        Each product is special, and we wanted to give you an easy way to show them off. Here's where you can list out any relevant properties that the customer might want to see.
    variant_selector:
      button_action: next
      title: Variants
      selector: .variant-container
      body_text: |+
        Variants are a great way to give your customers options, so we made it as simple as possible to create & manage as many variants as you need.
    images:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /products?&guided_tour=true
      title: Product Images
      selector: .product-page__images
      body_text: |+
        You want to show off your product, and your customers want to see what they'll receive. With Solidus, managing & storing your product images is simple.
  index:
    search_bar:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /admin/orders
      title: Search Bar
      selector: .search-bar
      body_text: |+
        For the customers that know exactly what they're looking for, Solidus comes with a robust search feature out-of-the-box. Just like on a category page, you can filter through search results by any number of properties.

        Now let's move on to the admin section!
spree/admin/orders:
  index:
    introduction:
      button_action: next
      title: Solidus Admin
      body_text: |+
        Behold, this is the Solidus admin UI.

        On the left, you'll see the main navigation bar. There you'll find all the resources you'll need to manage your E-Commerce store. You can even minimize the bar to make it less obtrusive.
    filtering:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /admin/orders/R987654321/edit
      title: Filtering
      selector: "#table-filter"
      body_text: |+
        This is the order index page. You'll see a list of completed orders here, with some handy tools for finding the right one.

        Highlighted below is the filtering menu, where you can use properties like order number, completed date, or order status to find the orders that you're looking for.

        If you want to see user carts instead, you can uncheck "Only show completed orders".

    controls:
      button_action: next
      title: Order Controls
      selector: .main-header
      body_text: |+
        Now we're going to look at an individual order. Like most resource pages, at the top of the page are some controls for managing the resource. You can use these buttons to cancel the order, approve the order, or or even resend the order confirmation email.
    navigation:
      button_action: next
      title: Navigation
      selector: .tabs
      body_text: |+
        This is where you can navigate to different sections of the order, such as payments or returns.
    order_info:
      button_action: next
      title: Order Information
      selector: .content-sidebar
      body_text: |+
        In order to have the full picture when working with the order, we have an order information panel that displays relevant order information.
    shipment:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /admin/orders/R987654321/payments
      title: Shipments
      selector: .js-shipment-edit
      body_text: |+
        Finally, here's where you can see what was ordered by the customer, as well as any relevant details such as shipping cost or tracking information.

        When the order is ready to be shipped, you'll be able to use this page to ship it.
spree/admin/payments:
  index:
    payments:
      button_action: next
      title: Payments
      selector: "#payments"
      body_text: |+
        Payments are easy with Solidus. Your customers payments are displayed here, and you have the ability to capture, refund, or void those payments.
    new_payment:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /admin/products
      title: New Payment
      selector: "#new_payment_section"
      body_text: |+
        If you need to add a payment - for instance, if a customer wants to add an item after the order has been placed - new payments can be added using the New Payments button.
spree/admin/products:
  index:
    product_list:
      button_action: continue
      button_location: /admin/products/monogram-hoodie/edit

      body_text: |+
        Moving on to products, here you'll find a list of all of the products on your store.

        Let's move on to the edit page, so you can get a look at how products work in Solidus.
  edit:
    title_fields:
      button_action: next
      title: Editing a Product
      selector: ".left.col-9"
      body_text: |+
        Here's the product edit page. Highlighted below are fields for Name, Description, and Slug. Slugs are created automatically and in a human readable format, but you can override that here if you wish.

      button_location: /admin/products/monogram-hoodie/images
      title: Editing a Product
      selector: ".right.col-3"

      selector: .content-main
      body_text: |+
        Images are the lifeblood of E-Commerce, so we think it should be as easy as possible to manage them.
